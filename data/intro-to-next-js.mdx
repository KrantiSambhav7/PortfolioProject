# Introduction to Next.js: The React Framework for Production

In the world of modern web development, building fast, SEO-friendly, and scalable applications is crucial. While React revolutionized how we think about UI development, developers often find themselves handling routing, server-side rendering, and performance optimization manually. That’s where **Next.js** steps in — a powerful framework built on top of React that provides everything you need to build production-grade web apps out of the box.

## What is Next.js?

**Next.js** is a popular open-source React framework developed by **Vercel**. It enables developers to build server-rendered and statically generated websites and applications effortlessly. With a strong focus on performance, scalability, and developer experience, Next.js has become the go-to framework for building full-stack applications with React.

## Why Use Next.js?

While React focuses solely on the component-based UI, Next.js provides the missing pieces required for real-world applications, such as:

- **File-based routing** — No need for external routing libraries.
- **Server-side rendering (SSR)** and **static site generation (SSG)** for SEO and performance.
- **API routes** to build full-stack apps without setting up a backend server.
- **Built-in image optimization**, CSS support, and more.

These features make Next.js a complete toolkit for building fast, user-friendly websites with modern best practices baked in.
